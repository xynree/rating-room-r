# Rating Room
Rating Room is a desktop application built with Rust, Tauri and Svelte that allows users to rate various topics and track their progress over time. The application is designed to provide a simple and efficient way to keep track of personal progress and gain insight into how their ratings change over time.

## Installation
To install the application, follow these steps:

1. Install Rust and Node.js if you haven't already.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/xynree/rating-room-r.git`

4. Install the required dependencies: `pnpm install`

## Usage
Once you have installed and launched the application, you will be presented with a simple interface that allows you to create, edit, and delete ratings for various topics. The application uses a simple star rating system to allow you to rate each topic on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.

You can create new ratings by clicking on the "New Rating" button in the top right corner of the interface. From there, you can choose the topic that you want to rate and assign a rating to it.

The main interface of the application allows you to view all of your ratings and see how they have changed over time. You can sort your ratings by topic, date, or rating to gain insight into your progress and identify areas where you need to improve.
